## **Description**
---
This section explains how to scale services within a **Docker Compose** application. Scaling a service means running multiple instances of that service, which is useful for load balancing or handling increased traffic. In this case, we will demonstrate how to scale the **Java TodoApp** service while leaving the **MySQL** service as a single instance.

## **Problem Statement**
---
Scaling is required when there is a need to handle a higher volume of requests. For example, the **Java TodoApp** may need to handle more users simultaneously, so additional instances of the app should be spun up. With Docker Compose, you can easily scale a service by specifying the number of container instances you want to run.

## **Prerequisites**
---
Completion of all previous lab guides (up to Lab Guide-07) is required before proceeding with Lab Guide-08.

## **Software Requirement**

- **Docker Desktop**: Installed on your Windows machine.
- **Docker Compose**: Included in Docker Desktop.
- **TodoAPP_MYSQl**: To download the source folder [**click here**](https://github.com/SwayaanTechnologies/TodoApp_MySQL/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## **Hardware Requirement**

- Minimum of 4 GB RAM
- At least 2 cores in the processor
- Additional CPU and RAM may be required based on the number of scaled instances

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step-1 :: Create Standard Folder Structure**

Ensure your folder structure and the **docker-compose.yml** file are correctly set up.


### **Step-2 :: Write docker-compose.yml**

The **docker-compose.yml** file defines the services and their configurations. Hereâ€™s the multi-container configuration for the **Java TodoApp** and **MySQL**:

```yaml
    
    services:
      # MySQL Database Service
      db:
        image: mysql
        container_name: mysql_db
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P@ssw0rd
          MYSQL_DATABASE: tododb
          MYSQL_PASSWORD: P@ssw0rd
        ports:
          - "3306:3306"
        networks:
          - todoapp_network
        volumes:
          - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

      # Java TodoApp Service
      todoapp:
        build:
          context: ./todoapp
        container_name: todoapp
        ports:
          - "8081"
        depends_on:
          - db
        environment:
          SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:mysql://db:3306/tododb
          SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: root
          SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: P@ssw0rd
        networks:
          - todoapp_network

    networks:
      todoapp_network:
        driver: bridge

    volumes:
      db_data:
```
>**Note**: To scale the todoapp service, you need to remove the static port mapping (8081:8081) for the containers. Instead, let Docker assign random dynamic ports on the host for each container while keeping the internal application port the same.

### **Step-3 :: Deploy the Multi-Container Application**

To deploy the application with Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start both the **TodoApp** and **MySQL** containers.

---

### **Step-4 :: Scale Services in the Docker Compose Application**

To handle increased load on your **Java TodoApp**, you can scale the **todoapp** service to run multiple containers.

1. **Scaling the TodoApp Service**:

    To scale the **TodoApp** service to 3 instances, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --scale todoapp=3
    ```

    This command will:
    - Spin up 3 instances of the **todoapp** service.
    - Automatically assign different ports to each new instance (if necessary).
    - Ensure all instances are connected to the same network and can interact with the **MySQL** database.

2. **Verifying Scaled Containers**:

    You can check the running instances using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose ps
    ```

    The output should show multiple `todoapp` containers running:

3. **Scaling Down**:

    To reduce the number of running instances (e.g., scaling down to 1 instance):

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --scale todoapp=1
    ```

    This will stop and remove the extra instances while keeping one instance running.
